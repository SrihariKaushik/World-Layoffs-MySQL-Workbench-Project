# World-Layoffs-MySQL-Workbench-Project
Project Workflow:
Data Cleaning: Conducted extensive data cleaning in MySQL Workbench to handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies, ensuring a reliable dataset for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Using SQL queries, performed EDA to uncover trends such as:
Layoff distribution by industry and region.
Monthly and yearly layoff trends.
Key economic or organizational factors linked to layoff spikes.
Analysis of company size, location, and other factors contributing to workforce reductions.

Insights and Decision Support: Based on the EDA, identified patterns that highlight the industries and regions most impacted by layoffs, as well as the timing and scale of layoff events. This analysis supports stakeholders in understanding the broader economic implications and assists organizations in risk assessment and strategic planning.

This project serves as a critical resource for HR professionals, policymakers, and business leaders, offering data-driven insights into the global layoff trends that shape workforce dynamics across industries.
